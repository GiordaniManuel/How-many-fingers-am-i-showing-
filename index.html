                <p>I'm Manuel Giordani, a web developer with a real passion for front-end design.</p>
                <p>After studying for a year at an online school, I learned the basics of full-stack development and got
                    hands-on with:</p>
                <p> HTML/HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL.</p>
                <p>While I've picked up some back-end skills along the way, my true love is in front-end development,
                </p>
                <p>where I can combine creativity with code.</p>
                <p>Right now, I'm diving into Bootstrap and loving how it simplifies responsive design.</p>
                <p>But I'm always looking for new things to learn, and I'm excited to keep expanding my skills beyond
                    just the basics.</p>

                <h2 id="projects">My Projects</h2>
                <p>I've had the chance to work on a few projects that really show what I can do with front-end
                    development.</p>
                <p>From portfolios to responsive websites, I enjoy bringing ideas to life through clean and effective
                    design.</p>

                        <h4>BBC Homepage Clone:</h4>
                        <p> A clone of a BBC page built using HTML and CSS. The main goal was to replicate the layout
                            and style of the original site, focusing on the page structure, multimedia content, and
                            responsive design. </p>

                        <h4>Three Circles Challenge:</h4>
                        <p>This project features a website centered around three interactive circles.The objective
                            was to make each circle disappear upon clicking, utilizing JavaScript for the
                            functionality. The site also incorporates HTML and CSS to create a visually appealing layout
                            and style. This
                            project highlights my skills in JavaScript, demonstrating how to manipulate the DOM and
                            create engaging user experiences.</p>

                        <p>In this interactive game, the user is presented with a random number of fingers shown, and
                            their task is to guess the number by typing their answer into an input field. The game is
                            primarily focused on JavaScript, which generates the random number and checks the user's
                            guess. HTML and CSS are used to create a simple layout</p>
